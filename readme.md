The Simple Lottery Checker v 1.2

The application can target to find lotteries of six-number results. This website includes users authorization system. It can save the chosen numbers. The application has support for languages selection. I have built it using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The author tried really hard to make the application very good but he is not responsible for any errors.

You can see how it works: http://projects.kalowski.com/lotterychecker/

Note: This project is waiting for the next version because the current is not fully compatible with the new standards of programming.
