The Simple Lottery Checker v 1.1

The application can target to find lotteries of six-number results.
This website includes users authorization system. It can save the chosen numbers.
I have built it using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The author tried really hard to make the application very good but he is not responsible for any errors.

You can see how it works:
